Wave Audio Reconstruction Program in Python
By Varun Chandramohan, 2016.

About the Program
-----------------
The program demonstrates an environment to perform an analysis of the frequencies of a two-channel wave audio source.  For this step, DTFT (Discrete Time Fourier Transform) of the wave audio source (a wave file) is performed.
Assuming that the necessary analysis is performed, next step is to "sew back" the original wave audio from the frequency information.  
For this, the IDTFT (Inverse Discrete Time Fourier Transform) is used.  To play the reconstructed wave audio, the contents are written into a output wave file "Output.wav". Playback of this file is attempted to verify the authenticity of the reconstructed data.

You would need a system running a Python editor to run this program.  As this program contains signal plots, the Python editor is best suited if it has the MATPLOTLIB module.  As the program contains audio, a speaker can connected to the system to listen to the sound.

Thank you for your interest.


The audio source used for this program is placed in the same folder as that of the .py script file.
The name of the source is by default "Input File.wav".  You can replace the file with any other two-channel wave audio file and name it to "Input File.wav".

The destination is a wave audio file named "Output File.wav".  You can replace the file with any other wave audio file and name it to "Output File.wav".
